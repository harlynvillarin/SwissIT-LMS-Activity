    <h1>Why I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
    <p><b>Swimming</b> is my most favorite activity in the <b>summer</b>. When the <i>sun</i> is shining, and the <i>air</i> is warm, you will find me dipping into my <b><i>backyard pool</i></b>. It’s not an impressive pool, only <i><b>three feet deep</b></i>, but it's mine.</p>
